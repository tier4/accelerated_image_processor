# Accelerated Image Processor Python API

This package provides Python bindings of `accelerated_image_processor`.
It is intended to be a thin, performance-oriented wrapper around the C++ API.

Currently, the main public modules are:

- `accelerated_image_processor.common`: Common utilities and data structures.
- `accelerated_image_processor.compression`: Compression and decompression functionality.
